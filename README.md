This is the Netflix Friend Finder - the best way to meet new friends and find the latest movies to watch on Netflix! Utilizing the unofficial Netflix online Global Search (uNoGS) API, our app pulls the most recently added Netflix movies and displays them on our homepage in real-time. 

Our app uses Firebase as its backend to authenticate users upon logging in and allows new users to sign up for an account. Once logged in, a user can click on the "Find Friends" tab on the navigation bar to start finding friends to watch new movies with! The app also stores user data locally using Firebase Cloud Firestore.
